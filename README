Data Availabilityï¼š

The complete data set for the G-NN potential development in this work are hosted at https://github.com/wwzhangxmu/Artificial-Neural-Network-Potential-PtAlSiOH


This directory contains:

PtAlSiOH.input - The last trained G-NN potential, which is developed and compatible with LASP software.
lasp.in - Control the G-NN potential training setup. 
adjust_factor - Control the relative weights of energy, force, and stress.
lasp.sh - Script for the job submission.

structure-information.xlsx - The chemical formula for structures (57071 in Total) in the G-NN potential training.
TrainFor.z01 - TrainFor.txt, data file containing the stress and force for all structures.
TrainStr.z01 - TrainStr.txt, data file containing the energy and coordinate information of all structures.
